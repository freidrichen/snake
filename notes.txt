Bugs:
- Occational graphic freezes, (until keypress)?

Features:
- Switch to ggez!
  - Double check if things are in the correct modules/files
- Draw score
- Death screen and restart key
- Improve increasing speed further:
  - Cap speed
    - Cap early levels earlier?
  - Scale score by speed and/or level?

Possible features:
- Power-ups
  - Pick food from range
  - Slow down
  - Dont grow
  - Invinsible (simply paus when colliding until another direction is chosen) (limited number of stops or limited time)
  - Coil (shrink to size 1 and then grow again)
  - Offspring (normal snake pauses, offspring goes out in its stead. If offspring collides with parent: merge instead of dying)
  - See future food
  - Also power ups that increase risk and reward
- Better controls
  - Be a little extra lenient when player is only _slightly_ early or _slightly_
    late and would have died. Much easier when using ggez.
  - Max length for direction queue?
- Intro screen
- Animations
  - Death animation
  - Level transition
- Sprites
  - Snake
  - Walls
- Sound
- Multiple levels
  - Handle better when there is no next level

Idiomatic code:
- Code structure for creating GameState and changing level
  - start_level method which transfers info from level struct to game_state
    struct! Does this really help?
  - GameStateBuilder? Allows creating a GameState e.g. without a level and then
    setting a level without allowing the GameState to not have a level, with the
    trade off there will be two almost identical change_level methods.
  - LevelID and global levels? Then setting a temporary level id is very light
    weight and doesn't feel so off. Seems hard with threads?
- Snake as a sub struct of game state?
- Error handling
  - Is there a head tile in the snake?
- Unit tests
  - Wraparound
  - Level loading
