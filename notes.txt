Bugs:

Features:
- Score
  - Render with bitmap font? (Perhaps create a struct with textures to pass into draw functions.) 
- Better controls
  - Be a little extra lenient when player is only _slightly_ early or _slightly_ late and would have died.
- Death screen and restart key

Possible features:
- Increasing speed
- Gate to next level
- Sprites
  - Snake
  - Walls
- Sound
- Animations
  - Death animation
- Intro screen
- Power-ups
  - Pick food from range
  - Slow down
  - Dont grow
  - Invinsible (simply paus when colliding until another direction is chosen) (limited number of stops or limited time)
  - Coil (shrink to size 1 and then grow again)
  - Offspring (normal snake pauses, offspring goes out in its stead. If offspring collides with parent: merge instead of dying)
  - See future food

Idiomatic code:
- Pass a duration to GameState.update which corresponds to time since last step? (Makes it very easy to implement increasing speed)
- Split snake out of game state?
- Refactor into main.rs and lib.rs
- Error handling
  - Is there a head tile in the snake?
  - IO and level syntax when loading levels
  - SDL:
    - Initiation
    - Drawing
- Unit tests
