Bugs:

Features:
- Score
  - Render with bitmap font?
- Better controls
  - React correctly to very fast key presses
  - Be a little extra lenient before collisions

Possible features:
- Increasing speed
- Gate to next level
- Animations
  - Death animation
- Power-ups
  - Pick food from range
  - Slow down
  - Dont grow
  - Invinsible (simply paus when colliding until another direction is chosen) (limited number of stops or limited time)
  - Coil (shrink to size 1 and then grow again)
  - Offspring (normal snake pauses, offspring goes out in its stead. If offspring collides with parent: merge instead of dying)
  - See future food
- Intro screen

Idiomatic code:
- Refactor into main.rs and lib.rs
- Error handling
  - Is there a head tile in the snake?
  - IO and level syntax when loading levels
  - SDL:
    - Initiation
    - Drawing
