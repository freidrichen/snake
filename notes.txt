Bugs:

Features:
- Switch to ggez!
  - Move stuff into ggez boilerplate
  - Double check if things are in the correct modules/files

Possible features:
- Fearlessly multithread graphics <-> game logic
- Death screen and restart key
- Score
  - Render as text in ggez
- Better controls
  - Be a little extra lenient when player is only _slightly_ early or _slightly_
    late and would have died. Much easier when using ggez.
- Sprites
  - Snake
  - Walls
- Sound
- Animations
  - Death animation
- Intro screen
- Power-ups
  - Pick food from range
  - Slow down
  - Dont grow
  - Invinsible (simply paus when colliding until another direction is chosen) (limited number of stops or limited time)
  - Coil (shrink to size 1 and then grow again)
  - Offspring (normal snake pauses, offspring goes out in its stead. If offspring collides with parent: merge instead of dying)
  - See future food
  - Also power ups that increase risk and reward

Idiomatic code:
- Error handling
  - Is there a head tile in the snake?
- Add unit tests e.g. to level loading
